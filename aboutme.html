                <p>Hey there, thanks for stopping by my page.
                    After finishing my Arts/Commerce degree, I decided I was way too an interesting person to be an
                    accountant and had barely left these shores. So my one way ticket to China was booked and I set
                    up a pretty comfortable life there for four years as a teacher and student. Upon return, I
                    worked in international education, where I was able to help students come over to our amazing
                    country and study. Then the dreaded Covid took hold of our life (dun dun dunnnnn) I believe the
                    loss of my job from covid to be more of a blessing in disguise. It has allowed me the time to
                    jump head first into an industry that I had always had the burning desire to be a part of in
                    some way. As I was always pretty good at learning languages, I thought why not try it with
                    computer languages, and so my web developer career began. <br><br> My desired end game is to become
                    a
                    full stack developer working on projects that make others lives better.
                    When I’m not sat in front of a screen, I can be found in the ocean getting dumped by waves, in a
                    kick-boxing gym getting beaten up, or timing myself with a sudoku puzzle.“
